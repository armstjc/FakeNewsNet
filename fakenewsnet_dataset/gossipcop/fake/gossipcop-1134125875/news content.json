Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an \"escape plan\" to leave him.\n\n\"Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There's concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.\"\n\n\"None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian's rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it's 'false' she's intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.\"\n\n\"[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.\"\n\n\"He's doing really good. He's in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he's just focused on that.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/bd5fdcca-133e-46a5-8247-197cded8dadf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c819574b-1916-4c5b-9192-aca6feb6cd2f.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c4ef2327345d36a953414934ea55324?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a786e17f-397c-4a80-9eb4-8c2caaf641c4.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b4635c11-c2d7-41ec-adbc-312688e9db24.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/8fecf661-9a26-45d2-a6ee-f650c8cb9b65.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardshian-isnt-divorcing-kanye-west.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardshian-isnt-divorcing-kanye-west.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4906250/kim-kardashian-does-not-have-escape-plan-to-leave-kanye-west-debunked/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Does Not Have 'Escape Plan' To Leave Kanye West [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Does Not Have 'Escape Plan' To Leave Kanye West [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4906250/kim-kardashian-does-not-have-escape-plan-to-leave-kanye-west-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kim Kardashian Does Not Have 'Escape Plan' To Leave Kanye West [Debunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardshian-isnt-divorcing-kanye-west.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-19 17:39:24Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Kim Kardashian Does Not Have 'Escape Plan' To Leave Kanye West [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526751564.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
