Some fans were hoping Em (born Marshall Mathers) would declare his candidacy after he lyrically demolished President Donald Trump, 71, at the start of the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards. \u201cEminem is very happy that his take down of Trump is getting so much attention,\u201d a source close to the rapper EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe feels that he has to use his gift for good and dropping the rap is his way to get his message out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for taking it to the political stage and to run for office in any way? Not a chance in the world,\u201d the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, crushing the hopes of anyone wanting an Eminem 2020 campaign sticker. \u201cMarshall is not going to pull a Kanye [West] and announce his candidacy. The nonsense and the baggage that comes with politics, especially running for President would be outrageous.\u201d While Eminem is no stranger to being \u201coutrageous\u201d and causing a controversy or two (especially about Donald Trump), seems politics are just not his jam.\n\nAfter all, why dive into the political world when he could set the rap world on fire? Slim\u2019s freestyle, which he called \u201cThe Storm\u201d on Twitter (per CNN) saw him spit such red-hot lines like, \u201cSame sh*t that he tormented Hillary [Clinton] for and he slandered and does it some more. From his endorsement of [Steve] Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that\u2019s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\u201d Damn.\n\n\u201cEminem is a success at music and he wants to use his music for good. And it obviously shows that it is working with this recent attack on Trump,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHe wants to provoke change in the way he knows how, and that is through his music.\u201d So, that takes care of that. If music fans want to see a hip-hop influenced dude from Detroit run for officer, there\u2019s always that rumored Kid Rock, 46, senate run. That\u2019s\u2026something, right?\n\nDo you think Eminem should reconsider and run for office, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/katy-perry-black-swimsuit-orlando-bloom-vacation-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/emme-maribel-muniz-jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-wedding-backgrid-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lourdes-leon-bikini-family-yacht-backgrid-excl-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/versedskinHAserum.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eminem-president-2020-donald-trump-ftr.jpg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/momsarguing.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xaviera3-e1660671615994.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spencer-trina-court-change-gh-abc.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eminem-president-2020-donald-trump-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Thea Glassman", "Maya Gandara", "Jiji Ugboma", "Amy Mistretta", "Richard Simms"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/12/will-eminem-run-for-president-2020-donald-trump-rap/", "title": "Will Eminem Run For President In 2020 After Vicious Trump Takedown Rap?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "After dragging Donald Trump with an epic freestyle rap, fans are wondering: will Eminem run for president?
