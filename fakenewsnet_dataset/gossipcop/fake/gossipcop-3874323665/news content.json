A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him\u2014at church, the ice rink, and beyond. \u201cHe loves her. He wants her back,\u201d the source said, adding that Bieber \u201cmisses\u201d Gomez.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.\n\nBut Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. \u201c[He] doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself,\" the source told Us on March 12. \"The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn\u2019t need him.\u201d\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nThe break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: \"Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,\" a source told E! on March 21. \"It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. \"Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,\" a source told the outlet.\n\nBut Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n\n\n\n\nGomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nBieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies.", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-and-nick-jonas-attend-a-cocktail-reception-news-photo-1661114531.jpg?crop=0.786xw:0.524xh;0.105xw,0.0311xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/35c8ddc3-a768-4720-9593-fc3c6ea951cf-1661280828.jpeg?crop=0.746xw:0.597xh;0.0731xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-seen-near-the-seine-river-on-news-photo-1661191867.jpg?crop=0.665xw:0.444xh;0.215xw,0.0524xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-at-the-louvre-news-photo-1661090011.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.178xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2020-08-05-at-4-36-35-pm-1596663430.png?crop=0.867xw:1.00xh;0.0673xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-songassociation-ep93-lewiscapaldi-jp-cm-kk-v3-ap-v2-1575927996.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-bgus-2443393-001-1661094207.jpg?crop=0.625xw:0.488xh;0.255xw,0.131xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/harry-styles-and-olivia-wilde-are-seen-in-soho-on-march-15-news-photo-1661182155.jpg?crop=0.465xw:0.581xh;0.234xw,0.0882xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-serena-williams-and-hannah-davis-participate-news-photo-1661264028.jpg?crop=0.593xw:0.769xh;0.0192xw,0.0603xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-george-of-cambridge-princess-charlotte-of-cambridge-news-photo-1661168136.jpg?crop=0.634xw:1.00xh;0.0442xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/singer-adele-looks-on-next-to-rich-paul-during-the-first-news-photo-1626803763.jpg?crop=0.76784xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-uploaded-from-ios-145-1522788201.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-1522789523.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-arrive-at-zuma-on-october-06-news-photo-1587161442.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.699xh;0,0.0493xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/olivia-wilde-harry-styles-gettyimages-1182819489.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-1522789523.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-1522789523.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19674683/justin-bieber-wants-selena-gomez-back-report/", "title": "All Justin Bieber Wants Is to Get Back Together With Selena Gomez", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Justin Bieber Still Loves Selena Gomez Back - Bieber Misses Selena, Wants to Reconcile Report", "description": "The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup\u200bmay be sinking in for the Biebs, or so \u200bPeople\u200b's new report suggests\u200b.
