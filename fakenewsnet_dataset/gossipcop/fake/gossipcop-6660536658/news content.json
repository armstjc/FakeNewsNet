A recent cover of the publication featured a photo of Vergara dancing with another man with the headline \"It's Over!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe image showed Vergara without her wedding ring \u2014 but both the \"Modern Family\" actress and her husband say the picture was photoshopped.\n\n\"Big surprise everyone but Star created a fake story and then photo shopped my wife's engagement ring off of her finger in order to sell magazines,\" Manganiello, 40, wrote in a heated Instagram post. \"They are run by malicious trash. Do the world a favor and don't buy their garbage.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara each blasted a report claiming they had broken up. (FREDERIC J.
