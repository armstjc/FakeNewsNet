Earlier in the week, she and Bloom had spent two days wandering the city for the photos in these pages, heading to some of their favorite places in town: the Maranui Cafe, a lax, bohemian restaurant in a historic lifeguarding school; Red Rocks Scientific Reserve, a desolate stretch of beach peppered with iron-hued volcanic rocks; and the Hill Street Farmers\u2019 Market, a Saturday morning institution. I joined them for much of the shoot and was surprised to see that no one paid them much attention \u2014 and not in that New York or Los Angeles way of pretending not to recognize a celebrity. \u201cPeople here are just really real,\u201d Bloom remarked during a break from the shoot, over lunch at the bistro Floriditas, a regular stop for the two. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the same things that everyone else does.\u201d\n\nBut because Kerr and Bloom are required to appear in public so often, they spent most of their time in Wellington at home, away from the demands of the world. A typical morning: Bloom would cook breakfast and brew a pot of tea while Kerr fed Flynn. A typical evening: Kerr, the more ambitious chef of the two, would make dinner \u2014 grilled salmon and roasted chicken are favorites. After that she\u2019d put her iPod on shuffle and turn up the volume, signaling the start of an impromptu family dance party \u2014 Kerr, Bloom and Flynn getting down to everything from Dr. Dre to Mozart. An exception to this rule was made at the Botanic Garden, when Bloom rang Kerr on her cellphone and, on a whim, she suggested that he meet her at the park so they could catch the Shakespeare performance. A great idea, Bloom agreed, though he did have one caveat that reminded me of how protective they were of their privacy in Wellington: he made sure that I not join them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he\u2019s kind of the gatekeeper,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe has to be, as a husband and a father.\u201d Fair enough: If I were in his shoes, I would have asked me to leave, too. As I left, I imagined the three of them at the show, in the middle of a crowd and yet totally invisible.\n\nLater in the week I met up with Kerr at a cafe called Scorch-O-Rama (that it overlooks Scorching Bay doesn\u2019t quite make the name forgivable). A mellow little spot, it\u2019s just a few hundred yards from their house and had become a mainstay for the couple. Over something called \u201cgunpowder\u201d green tea, I asked her to describe a moment that epitomized what she loves about Wellington. Her face puckered up in thought. I had had a few of my own adventures since first meeting her, including an unexpected late night with strangers (who quickly felt like friends) at a cocktail lounge called Havana Bar near Cuba Street, Wellington\u2019s answer to Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford Avenue. Such moments seem particularly easy to come by in the city, and I figured Kerr, her homebody proclivities aside, might have a few to share. But after a moment, she simply pointed to a small sliver of beach across the street. \u201cThat beach right there? I take Flynn there a lot, just to play in the sand,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was there with him a few days ago, right after coming back from a job in Tokyo. He was covered in sand, I was covered in sand, but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d As they began to head back to the house, Bloom showed up on his mountain bike, which he often rode to the set of \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d \u201cOrlando started showing Flynn some tricks on his bike, and Flynn kept shouting, \u2018More! More!\u2019 \u201d Kerr paused for a moment. She is a woman who gets genuinely misty when discussing the joys of family. \u201cIt sounds so simple, I know,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s kind of what it\u2019s all about here. Just those small moments that you can\u2019t have anywhere else.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2012", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/19/t-magazine/19well-kerr/19well-kerr-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2012", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Amsden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html", "title": "Miranda Kerr Goes Kiwi", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "To cap off an extended stay in New Zealand with her family, Miranda Kerr gives Wellington a whirl in fall\u2019s white shirts and strappy flats.
