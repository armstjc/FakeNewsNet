Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his re-married ex,\u201d reads Kim, 36. \u201cRobert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d interrupts Khlo\u00e9, 33. \u201cLike, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, to sell a book, you\u2019re gonna make something up?\u201d says Kourtney, 37.\n\n\u201cDad so believed in him,\u201d Kim says. \u201cIt is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, \u2018Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing about you.\u2019 So she lied to me, because that is about me, if it\u2019s about our dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always had Caitlyn\u2019s back,\u201d she tells her sisters. \u201cBut she is a liar. She is not a good person.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Caitlyn was strained,\u201d Kim later admits in a confessional. \u201cI was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Threatens Caitlyn Jenner Over Her New Memoir \u2014 \u2018Talk Bad About My Mom, I Come for You\u2019\n\nIn her memoir, which was released April 25, Caitlyn claimed the late Robert Kardashian Sr. once implied he thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman \u2014 despite having served as the NFL star\u2019s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.\n\nCaitlyn, 67, wrote that she was in the car with Robert in the late \u201990s \u2014 following Simpson\u2019s initial acquittal and later conviction of manslaughter in a civil trial \u2014 when he allegedly said, \u201cI would\u2019ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication was obvious that [Robert] believed O.J. was guilty,\u201d she added.\n\nCaitlyn went on to speculate whether part of Robert\u2019s motivation behind defending Simpson was to obtain some form of revenge against his ex-wife Kris Jenner, who was close friends with Brown Simpson.\n\n\u201cI wonder if it was his way of saying to [Kris] what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big f\u2014 you,\u201d she wrote.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians season 14 premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
