Is that THE TELLTALE SCARF? (infusny-169/Swarbrick/INFphoto.com)\n\nOne of the great mysteries of the modern age has been solved - the identity of the cad who inspired Taylor Swift's breakup ditty, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\"\n\nThe ex who she used her axe to grind is reportedly actor Jake Gyllenahaal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's definitely about Jake,\" a source told US Weekly.\n\nSpeculation over which unseemly ex-boyfriend \u2014 from a pool that included Joe Jonas, \"Twilight\" star Taylor Lautner, John Mayer and Gyllenhaal \u2014 inspired Taylor Swift's new breakup song has mounted since its release last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonas told Maryland's 94.7 Fresh FM immediately after the song was released that he's not the guy. \"I can say it's not about me, because I don't think we've ever tried another time,\" Jonas told the radio station when prodded if he thought he was the former boyfriend referenced on \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\"\n\nAnd Mayer has already been the subject of a biting Swift song - the acerbic \"Dear John.\"\n\n\"It made me feel terrible. Because I didn't deserve it,\" Mayer told Rolling Stone magazine. \"I'm pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.\"\n\nThe country singer herself didn't spill the beans during an interview on \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday morning. But she did shed some light on the origin of the song.\n\n\"This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case,\" Swift told GMA. \"So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break up, get back together \u2014 just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, 'This is what we're writing.'\"\n\nBut other clues also pointed to Gyllenhaal, according The Huffington Post.\n\nThe actor playing the inconsiderate ex-love interest gives Swift a scarf in the video for \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" The singer was photographed wearing Gyllenhaal's scarf while they dated.\n\nPlus Swift and Gyllenhaal actually did briefly and unsuccessfully try to get back together. In January 2011, the off-again, off-again couple pair were photographed on a dinner date \u2014Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal after their breakup a few days earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe track will be on her next album, \"Red,\" which lands on Oct. 22.\n\nESacks@nydailynews.com", "images": ["https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/tronc/1657827651194.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/X5D7sUchp6SKbjni9bXH-I6lXKE=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DBBE6GFTPG64RSD5PNQXNGLQ6Y.jpg", "http://www.nydailynews.com/pf/resources/icons/Menu_Icon.svg?d=75", "https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/dlnRIpZz1OPwNxvVO8R5gn_zxoU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DBBE6GFTPG64RSD5PNQXNGLQ6Y.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/dlnRIpZz1OPwNxvVO8R5gn_zxoU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DBBE6GFTPG64RSD5PNQXNGLQ6Y.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/taylor-swift-back-jake-gyllenhaal-report-article-1.1153514", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u2019 about Jake Gyllenhaal: report", "meta_data": {"language": "English (United States), en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "One of the great mysteries of the modern age has been solved - the identity of the cad who inspired Taylor Swift\u2019s breakup ditty, \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d The ex who she used her axe to grind is reportedly actor Jake Gyllenahaal.", "twitter": {"description": "One of the great mysteries of the modern age has been solved - the identity of the cad who inspired Taylor Swift\u2019s breakup ditty, \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d The ex who she used her axe to grind is reportedly actor Jake Gyllenahaal.", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u2019 about Jake Gyllenhaal: report", "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/dlnRIpZz1OPwNxvVO8R5gn_zxoU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DBBE6GFTPG64RSD5PNQXNGLQ6Y.jpg", "site": "@NYDailyNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "One of the great mysteries of the modern age has been solved - the identity of the cad who inspired Taylor Swift\u2019s breakup ditty, \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d The ex who she used her axe to grind is reportedly actor Jake Gyllenahaal.", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u2019 about Jake Gyllenhaal: report", "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/dlnRIpZz1OPwNxvVO8R5gn_zxoU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DBBE6GFTPG64RSD5PNQXNGLQ6Y.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "New York Daily News", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/taylor-swift-back-jake-gyllenhaal-report-article-1.1153514"}, "robots": "noarchive", "googlebot-news": "index", "article": {"content_tier": "metered"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.nydailynews.com", "summary": ""}
