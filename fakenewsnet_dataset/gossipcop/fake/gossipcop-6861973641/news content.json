Hours after the president spoke, the Marine Corps commandant, General Robert B. Neller, wrote in a tweet that there is \u201cno place for racial hatred or extremism in @USMC. Our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment frame the way Marines live and act.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump delivered his remarks in the lobby of Trump Tower, where officials had spent much of the day trying to erase certain telltale signatures of the brand that would be caught on TV \u2014 most significantly, a blue curtain was placed over the Ivanka Trump display in the lobby.\n\nIf Mr. Trump was aware of the reaction that would ensue after his clearly improvised remarks, he appeared immune to the consequences of those words, which electrified the lobby of his signature office building. It was there in 2015 that he launched his presidential campaign with a furious assault on illegal immigrants and a declaration that Mexicans were \u201crapists\u201d bringing crime into the United States.\n\nInstead, the president seemed determined to convince any doubters that he did not misspeak in his first reaction to the events in Virginia on Saturday.\n\nMr. Trump said his initial statement was shaped by a lack of information about the events in Charlottesville, even though television statements had been broadcasting images of the violence throughout the morning.\n\n\u201cThere was no way of making a correct statement that early,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters. I didn\u2019t know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=7ae275ad012b9815306217d39bd7239b1058c2dfdfa0c6deb058d9af1bde65a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-2/merlin-to-scoop-126035954-28496-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=7ae275ad012b9815306217d39bd7239b1058c2dfdfa0c6deb058d9af1bde65a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael D.
