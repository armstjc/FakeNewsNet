Shelton supposedly broke up with Stefani last month but the No Doubt singer is still clinging on to hope that they will get back together.\n\nBlake reportedly broke up with Gwen in February right before he went on tour, according to In Touch Weekly. The celebrity gossip magazine claims that a source close to the couple told them that Stefani is not taking the breakup too well.\n\n\"Gwen doesn't know what hit her,\" said the source. \"She's heartbroken.\"\n\nJealousy has apparently gotten the better of Gwen as Blake has had enough of her \"neediness and all the drama,\" which forced him to dump her, according to the source.\n\nRumor has it that Gwen is not too happy with the closeness between her boyfriend of two years and The Voice Season 13 winner Chloe Kohanski. Previous rumors say Blake and Chloe have developed a bond deeper than a student-teacher relationship, reported the Hollywood Gossip. This allegedly led Gwen to be suspicious of the two.\n\n\"She told him she didn't want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her,\" the source said.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Shelton and Stefani have been fighting because of the 24-year-old Kohanski.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/eff5339e-ea4f-4d39-a8fe-dcce4095cda9.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4b0fc539f03072b22dffa8ac42dcdf0b?s=800", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6da9a964-c0c0-4050-a4e9-16bc8469cf49.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c81bfb89-640e-49a0-aef8-efe1771cb370.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fbd0bfe6-f10e-424a-8b86-eb0a1f1e730d.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/806191c1-5dcc-4f74-a82e-e00906bce03d.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/dfc21e3f-243a-428a-91b0-b07faf6db4fe.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4827007/blake-shelton-rumored-to-have-dumped-gwen-stefani-according-to-in-touch-weekly/", "title": "Blake Shelton Rumored To Have Dumped Gwen Stefani, According To 'In Touch Weekly'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Rumored To Have Dumped Gwen Stefani, According To 'In Touch Weekly'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4827007/blake-shelton-rumored-to-have-dumped-gwen-stefani-according-to-in-touch-weekly/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Blake Shelton Rumored To Have Dumped Gwen Stefani, According To 'In Touch Weekly'", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-03-15 01:30:54Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Blake Shelton Rumored To Have Dumped Gwen Stefani, According To 'In Touch Weekly'", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521077454.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
