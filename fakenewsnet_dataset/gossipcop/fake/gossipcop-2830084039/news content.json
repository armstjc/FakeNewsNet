Outside the White House, several hundred people protested the decision, chanting, \u201cNo hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.\u201d\n\nIndividual schools will remain free to let transgender students use the bathrooms with which they are most comfortable. And the effect of the administration\u2019s decision will not be immediate because a federal court had already issued a nationwide injunction barring enforcement of the Obama order.\n\nThe dispute highlighted the degree to which transgender rights issues, which Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for during the campaign, continue to split Republicans, even as many in the party argue that it is time to move away from social issues and focus more on bread-and-butter pocketbook concerns.\n\nWithin the administration, it also threatened to become another distraction for Mr. Trump after a tumultuous first month in office.

They had argued that former President Barack Obama\u2019s policy would allow potential sexual predators access to bathrooms and create an unsafe environment for children.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b335440f46a939d7567acc7fae3f9d06bf25bd26a29de3c3004dc194f23c0a7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b335440f46a939d7567acc7fae3f9d06bf25bd26a29de3c3004dc194f23c0a7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy W.
