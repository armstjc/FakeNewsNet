Yet recent reports have suggested that the cast members of the show are at odds and that the drama which has resulted, is causing chaos behind the scenes.\n\nAn unreliable tabloid has suggested that the main stars of the show are not happy about their pay and their air time, which is supposedly causing tensions to run high behind the scenes of the long-running sitcom.\n\nGossip Cop notes the details of this recent rumor that has surfaced. The said source to these claims also insists that the former relationship between stars Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki has caused things to be awkward on-set.\n\nThe insider states that \"The short-lived relationship antagonized star Jim Parsons and created tensions among the entire cast. Now none of them socialize together at all once the cameras stop rolling.\"\n\nApparently there has never been a \"friendly\" relationship among cast members since the show aired, according to the same source, that is. However, the gossip policing site has reminded how Cuoco and Galecki are actually friendly on set since their split and joke around, as indicated by posts to social media.\n\n\"Cuoco and Galecki have remained on good terms since their 2010 split. Last year, Cuoco posted a funny Instagram photo of Galecki cuddling with her current boyfriend Karl Cook, and joked in the caption, 'Get off my man!' Clearly, there are no hard feelings between the exes and co-stars.\"\n\n\u2014 Celebrity Uncensored (@celebs_leaks) January 13, 2018\n\nThe massively successful sitcom would not have endured over the years if the rumored high tensions and drama were fact. Cast members clearly work well together and are set to continue bringing viewers hilarious and clever episodes weekly.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/bd5fdcca-133e-46a5-8247-197cded8dadf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c819574b-1916-4c5b-9192-aca6feb6cd2f.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/784fcf0a3514f31a582147119c01ff3d?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a786e17f-397c-4a80-9eb4-8c2caaf641c4.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b4635c11-c2d7-41ec-adbc-312688e9db24.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/8fecf661-9a26-45d2-a6ee-f650c8cb9b65.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4750778/big-bang-theory-drama-behind-the-scenes-not-causing-show-to-fall-apart-debunked/", "title": "'Big Bang Theory': Drama Behind The Scenes Not Causing Show To 'Fall Apart' [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Big Bang Theory': Drama Behind The Scenes Not Causing Show To 'Fall Apart' [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4750778/big-bang-theory-drama-behind-the-scenes-not-causing-show-to-fall-apart-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "'Big Bang Theory': Drama Behind The Scenes Not Causing Show To 'Fall Apart' [Debunked]", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-01-23 11:46:34Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "'Big Bang Theory': Drama Behind The Scenes Not Causing Show To 'Fall Apart' [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516707994.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
