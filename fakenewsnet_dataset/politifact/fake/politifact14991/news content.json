Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/US-constitution-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/migrants-assaulted-Mexican-officials-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242436258-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/aug-2022-man-gets-monkeypox-vaccine-file-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/Large-Group-Del-Rio-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1392461120-e1661267657516-200x151.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/Cartel-Murder--200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/06/MeghanMarkle-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1240725562-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1401843642-1-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/wi/ap/michigan-governor-kidnapping-plot-combo-of-images-by-kent-county-mich-jail-barry-croft-jr-left-200x124.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/07/Charlie-Crist-upclose-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/Blame-BlackRock-Pop-Up-Ad-Desktop-1612-\u00d7-850-px-336-\u00d7-280-px-640-\u00d7-480-px-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242275976-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1269207384-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/04/GettyImages-1238904698-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/BND-POD-KPax-640x480-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242419147-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
