But my feelings are clear: I\u2019m furious. I will not rest until we have righted the wrong these senators have done, and until we have changed our laws so we can look parents in the face and say: We are trying to keep your children safe. We cannot allow the status quo \u2014 desperately protected by the gun lobby so that they can make more money by spreading fear and misinformation \u2014 to go on.\n\nI am asking every reasonable American to help me tell the truth about the cowardice these senators demonstrated. I am asking for mothers to stop these lawmakers at the grocery store and tell them: You\u2019ve lost my vote. I am asking activists to unsubscribe from these senators\u2019 e-mail lists and to stop giving them money. I\u2019m asking citizens to go to their offices and say: You\u2019ve disappointed me, and there will be consequences.\n\nPeople have told me that I\u2019m courageous, but I have seen greater courage. Gabe Zimmerman, my friend and staff member in whose honor we dedicated a room in the United States Capitol this week, saw me shot in the head and saw the shooter turn his gunfire on others. Gabe ran toward me as I lay bleeding. Toward gunfire. And then the gunman shot him, and then Gabe died. His body lay on the pavement in front of the Safeway for hours.\n\nI have thought a lot about why Gabe ran toward me when he could have run away. Service was part of his life, but it was also his job. The senators who voted against background checks for online and gun-show sales, and those who voted against checks to screen out would-be gun buyers with mental illness, failed to do their job.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2013"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2013", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabrielle Giffords"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "title": "A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip (Published 2013)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2013", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "title": "Opinion | A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip (Published 2013)", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=2013", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-04-18T00:29:25.000Z", "modified_time": "2013-04-18T00:29:15.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000002178078, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/c1694612c65249e29b2cfd35a55b73a4", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2013", "byl": "By Gabrielle Giffords", "news_keywords": "Gun Control,,Sandy Hook Shooting;Newtown Shooting,Senate,Congress,NRA,US Politics", "pdate": 20130417, "CG": "opinion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1366257600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
