They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.\n\nThen there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many employers \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally \u2013 like our automakers \u2013 are at a huge disadvantage. And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it \u2013 about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care.\n\nFinally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.\n\nThese are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform this system. The question is how.\n\nThere are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada's, where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone. On the right, there are those who argue that we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.\n\nI have to say that there are arguments to be made for both approaches. But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have. Since health care represents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch. And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.\n\nDuring that time, we have seen Washington at its best and its worst.\n\nWe have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week. That has never happened before. Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups and even drug companies \u2013 many of whom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber on about eighty percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "title": "Obama\u2019s Health Care Speech to Congress", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama\u2019s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "type": "article", "title": "Obama\u2019s Health Care Speech to Congress (Published 2009)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "description": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama\u2019s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "title": "Obama\u2019s Health Care Speech to Congress (Published 2009)", "description": "The following is the prepared text of President Obama\u2019s speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care, as released by the White House.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=2009", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/7e1e717d-f82a-5bcc-a9a1-d8676599d86d"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2009-09-09T23:59:10.000Z", "modified_time": "2009-09-10T00:15:28.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1247464489433, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/7e1e717d-f82a-5bcc-a9a1-d8676599d86d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/86ee286a23fe464e998862ac901d8321", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "pdate": 20090909, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "article", "PST": "Text", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/7e1e717d-f82a-5bcc-a9a1-d8676599d86d", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1252555200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
