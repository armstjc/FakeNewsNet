That's the change we need, Minnesota. (APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.\n\nThat man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. That's the change we need, Minnesota.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "type": "article", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul (Published 2008)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul (Published 2008)", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=2008", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2008-06-03T12:28:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2008-06-04T03:10:44.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "Presidential Election of 2008", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1194781760371, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/0d4ccb51fc004ba2966371e4539e3015", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,St Paul MN,2008 Presidential Election", "pdate": 20080603, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "article", "PST": "Text", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1212465600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
