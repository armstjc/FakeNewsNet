Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.\n\nWhatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nAt his news conference, Mr. Bush also sought to portray the plan as helping every American. \u201cThe government,\u201d he said, \u201cneeded to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren\u2019t going to let that happen.\u201d\n\nA program to help troubled borrowers refinance mortgages \u0097 along with an $800 billion increase in the national debt limit \u0097 was approved in July. But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship.\n\nRepresentative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administration\u2019s proposal.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2008", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David M.
