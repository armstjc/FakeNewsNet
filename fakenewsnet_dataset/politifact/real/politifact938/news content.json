More than 430 product brands have been recalled.\n\nThe delays meant Sarah Kirchner of Belle Plaine, Minn., whose two young children became ill from the outbreak, for weeks had no idea how to prevent a recurrence. Her 3-year-old son, Michael, was hospitalized for four days with intense pain in his head, neck and shoulders, she said.\n\n\u201cHe had a spinal tap, bone scan, M.R.I. and a CT scan,\u201d Ms. Kirchner said. \u201cI\u2019m still so worried about him.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said she had been asking top food and drug officials for years if they needed authority for ordering mandatory recalls.\n\nBut the officials said companies cooperated when recalls were needed.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t even get a press release out on this stuff without industry approval. It\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d said Ms. DeLauro, who promised to offer legislation on Wednesday that would split the agency\u2019s food oversight into a separate entity with mandatory recall authority and other powers.\n\nPublic health officials pinpointed the Blakely plant as the source of the salmonella outbreak on Jan. 9. The peanut company announced a limited recall on Jan. 13 and expanded it on Jan. 16. The company waited until Jan. 28 before recalling all products made at the plant in 2007 and 2008, even though it had known since 2007 that tests of products showed contamination with salmonella.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gardiner Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "type": "article", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval (Published 2009)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval (Published 2009)", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=2009", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2009-02-03T03:57:31.000Z", "modified_time": "2009-02-03T03:57:10.000Z", "section": "Health", "tag": "Recalls and Bans of Products", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1231546923693, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/54967bb241d74f99aff38fdfb5b84e1b", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2009", "byl": "By Gardiner Harris", "news_keywords": "Peanut Corporation of America,Salmonella,Bacteria,Peanut,Food Safety,Recalls and Bans", "pdate": 20090202, "CG": "health", "SCG": "policy", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1233637200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
